            <h3>About me</h3>
            <p>
                Hello, my name is Evan Cole. I am currently studying Computer Science
                at The University of Texas at Dallas. My expected graduation date is in
                May of 2021.
            </p>

            <p id="p2">
                Below details some information regarding my programming skills and experience:
            </p>

            <p>
                My first experience programming began in 2016 when I enrolled in AP
                Computer Science during high school. Since then I have continued to 
                expand my knowledge during my time here at UTD.
            </p>

            <p>
                Currently, I have experience in the following languages:
                <ul>
                    <li>Java, Python, C, C++, C#, MIPS Assembly Language, Javascript, HTML, and
                        CSS
                    </li>
                </ul>

                The majority of my experience lies within Java, Python, and C/C++. 
                Most of my schoolwork and personal projects are completed in these languages. 
                <br><br>Recently, I have been investing time familiarizing myself with the process
                and technologies involving front-end web development and UI design. I possess
                a firm belief that a webpage should be easy to read, pleasant to view,
                simple, and lightweight. I have tried my best to embody these principles in the
                design of this website.
